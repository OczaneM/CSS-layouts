# CSS-layouts

### **Measuring various CSS layout systems with personal metrics**

The design for this page is based on some ideas of what I'd like my future personal websites to look like.
It will be used to experiment with different CSS layouts.
A bit of JS will be plugged in to dynamically switch between layouts with the press of a button

_Metrics:_

1. Does it make my css more/less readable
2. Does it have docs that are easy to follow
3. How often do I have to check the docs to figure something out
